Project Overview:

This project demonstrates parent-child communication in React, where the parent (`App.js`) passes a function as a prop to the child (`Childcom.js`). The child invokes this function to send data ("My name is Bob") back to the parent, which updates its state and displays the message.


Key Concepts:

State Management: 

Using useState to the functional components to manage state. It enables the `App` component to store and update the `childname` dynamically.

Props: Passing data and functions between components.

Callback Functions: Enabling the child component to send data back to the parent.


Output:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
